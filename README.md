# Self-Balancing-Two-Wheeled-Robot

•	Designed a PID control system to balance and smoothly correct for tilt
•	Utilized dynamic analysis to synthesize an algorithm for accurately reading tilt
•	Procedurally tuned the PID to achieve predictable behaviours and desirable results
•	Bench tested components to verify they meet design specifications before implementation
•	Documented the design process, control methodology, and performance results
